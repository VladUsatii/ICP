This has never been done before. You can read the white paper at https://www.readproduct.com/user/vlad .

*Click the Publications tab to read this white paper.*

## Getting Started

Download the package by cloning or just plain downloading this pack of files to a folder on your computer. Files are encrypted on a central server, and ICP saves your IP before you get started.

> Note that simply starting up ICP will write your IP and hex code to the hashprof file on our root server. If you don't want to share your IP with ICP Foundation at Product, please refrain from downloading and running this software.

## API

Currently no info on APIs. This is our first push to Git & GitHub for the project! :+1:
